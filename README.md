This is a port of the original 0.80 code branch to native 64-bit and to Android platform.

There is a context-aware overlay controller for Android.  It has been tested with top-level menus and Supermelee.  It has not yet been tested in Campaign and likely will have many bugs.

The overlay UX controller uses the "claw grip" style made popular by modern mobile shooters.  Not the most comfortable thing in the world, but surprisingly effective at allowing all the inputs needed for effective melee play.
